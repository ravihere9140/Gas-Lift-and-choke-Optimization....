Case Study 1: North Sea Platform

"BP implemented similar ML optimization on Forties field"
"15% production increase, $2M annual savings"
"Key: Real-time data integration with optimization.

Part A: Gas Lift Systems (10 minutes)
"Let's start with gas lift. Who can explain what gas lift is?"

Key Concepts to Cover:

Purpose: Artificial lift method to reduce fluid density in tubing
Physics: Gas injection reduces hydrostatic pressure, allowing reservoir pressure to push fluids to surface
Key Variables:
Gas injection rate (too little = insufficient lift, too much = waste + instability)
Wellhead pressure (back-pressure on system)
Reservoir pressure (driving force)
Water cut (affects fluid density)
Well depth (affects hydrostatic head)
Interactive Moment: "If I increase gas injection rate, what happens to production? Anyone?"

Students might say "increases"
"Actually, it's more complex! There's an optimal point. Too much gas creates turbulence and can actually reduce flow!"
Part B: Choke Flow Physics (10 minutes)
"Now, chokes. These are our production control devices. Think of them like a garden hose nozzle."

Key Concepts:

Purpose: Control flow rate and wellhead pressure
Critical Flow: When pressure drop is high enough, flow becomes sonic
Bean size: Measured in 64ths of an inch
Key Variables:
Upstream/downstream pressure (driving force)
Fluid properties (density, viscosity)
Gas-liquid ratio (affects flow patterns)
Engineering Reality Check: "In the field, engineers often adjust chokes based on intuition. We're going to use data and ML to do better!"

Why Machine Learning? (15 minutes)
Traditional Approach vs ML Approach
Traditional:

Manual adjustments based on experience
Simple correlations and nomographs
Trial and error in the field
Limited optimization capability
ML Approach:

Data-driven optimization
Handles complex, non-linear relationships
Continuous learning and improvement
Predictive capabilities

Real Industry Example: "Chevron reported 15-20% production increases using ML optimization on their gas lift systems. Shell saved over $1M annually on a single platform using automated choke optimization."
